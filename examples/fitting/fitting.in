# A basic test of fitting. We define a single muon with no interactions except
# for a dissipation term, causing an exponential decay. We then fit the rate
# of decay using a single variable g, starting at g=0.1, bounded from 0 to 
# positive infinity.
# 
# Some target data with added artificial noise is used as the "experiment"
# that we are trying to fit. We expect the decay to go like 
#
#    0.5*exp(-g*pi*t)
# 
# with g our variable, t the time, and pi=3.14159... 
# 
# The 0.5 factor appears in front as that's the moment of the muon.
# With the data provided, we expect the fitting to find that g = 0.2
