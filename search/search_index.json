While single spins can sometimes be usefully visualised in a classical way, as dipoles with a definite direction that are subject to rotation by precession under applied fields, this classical description quickly breaks down when multiple coupled spins are involved - and that is the premise of any and all mildly interesting muon science experiments. So, there's very little way out of the fact that muon experiments have to be described with quantum mechanical equations. Here we're going to give a quick overview of the relevant equations, their meaning, and the matrix formalism that is used to implement them numerically in MuSpinSim. The basics: spin states and Hamiltonians Spin states as vectors Quantum mechanics is often taught first with an eye to particles, like electrons, which are described by a complex-valued wavefunction \\(\\psi(x)\\) all across the three-dimensional space. The value of the wave function at a point corresponds to the amplitude of finding the particle at that point. Quantum amplitudes act like probabilities, in the sense that their square modulus \\(\\psi^*\\psi\\) expresses the probability of finding the particle at that specific point, but being complex numbers have the peculiar property that they can interfere with themselves constructively or destructively, leading to many of quantum mechanics' most counter-intuitive results (such as the way an electron's probability amplitudes add up to fringes in the double slit experiment). When it comes to individual spins, the situation is not that different, except for the fact that the wavefunction is not defined over an infinite amount of points in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) ; instead, it is defined over a discrete number of states that the spin can occupy. In the simplest case, a spin-\u00bd particle, there are just two possible states: up, \\(\\mid\\uparrow\\rangle\\) and down, \\(\\mid\\downarrow\\rangle\\) . For this reason, a spin-\u00bd particle can also be considered a \"quantum bit\", or qubit . Electrons, muons and protons (namely, hydrogen nuclei) are all spin-\u00bd particles. The wavefunction of a spin particle can therefore be expressed with just two complex coefficients: \\[ \\mid\\psi_{1/2}\\rangle = a\\mid\\uparrow\\rangle + b\\mid\\downarrow\\rangle \\] with \\(a^*a+b^*b = 1\\) as a normalisation condition. One possible convention to write this wavefunction and manipulate it in a computer program is to treat these states as the basis for a vector space (which effectively, they are: they obey the same inner product rules as the versors for a regular Euclidean 2D space). Then we can write the wavefunction as a column vector: $$ \\mid\\uparrow\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\mid\\downarrow\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\mid\\psi_{1/2}\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\end{bmatrix} $$ Conversely, we can write the complex conjugate versions of these states (the \"bras\" to these \"kets\") as row vectors: \\[ \\langle\\uparrow\\mid = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\langle\\downarrow\\mid = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\langle\\psi_{1/2}\\mid = \\begin{bmatrix} a^* & b^* \\end{bmatrix} \\] (where of course it's important to remember that the coefficients too are to be conjugated). That way, one can see for example how the inner product results naturally as a scalar product between vectors. Operators as matrices If we are describing spin states as vectors, operators can be described as matrices instead. In particular, for the spin-\u00bd particle, we have the Pauli matrices: $$ S_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad S_y = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad S_z = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} $$ for the three spatial components of the spin. Together with the identity matrix, these form a complete basis for the operators for this kind of spin. These operators can be easily used to compute expectation values. For example, consider the following state: \\[ \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} \\] We can find the expectation values of its components by applying simple matrix product rules: \\[ \\langle S_x \\rangle = \\langle\\psi\\mid S_z \\mid\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}i \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{bmatrix} = 0 \\] \\[ \\langle S_y \\rangle = \\langle\\psi\\mid S_z \\mid\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\] \\[ \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi\\mid S_z \\mid\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2}i \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\] We can learn a few things from it. The three expectation values along x, y, z would correspond, classically, to the three components of the spin's magnetic moment. In classical terms, this would be a vector making a \\(60\u00b0\\) angle with the vertical, pointing towards the y direction. In general this example shows two important features of spin-\u00bd states: the component along z of the moment is determined by the relative probabilities of finding the spin up or down. If the probability are equal, the component along z is zero; the component in the xy plane can only be non-zero if the spin exists in some mixture of up and down states, and it's maximum if the up and down states have amplitudes with the same modulus. The specific direction of the component is then controlled by the relative phase of those amplitudes. Hamiltonians Hamiltonians are operators with the additional required property of being Hermitian , that is, they have to be identical to their conjugate transpose. In this formalism they are described by matrices with the requirement that $$ H = H^\\dag, $$ which is fairly easily checked.","title":"Theory of spin dynamics - I"},{"location":"theory_1/#theory-of-spin-dynamics-i","text":"","title":"Theory of spin dynamics - I"},{"location":"theory_1/#introduction","text":"Spin is an essentially quantum mechanical phenomenon.
