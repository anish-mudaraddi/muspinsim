How to work with the documents:

* install MkDocs with `pip install mkdocs`
* launch the local development server with `mkdocs serve`
* once satisfied with the changes, deploy to the Github Pages hosting with `mkdocs gh-deploy`

Warning: when adding or editing math equations, make sure to have a blank line after the closing `$$` tag. For some reason, without it, MathJax rendering can fail.
